# pvtr2vtr
> Parallel vtr converter

The Python script converts multiple Paraview serial output to a single output. One possible solution is provided in this repository, but you can definitely change it to fit your requirements.

In the folder `example`, two snapshots of flow field and a .pvd collection file are provided. In each snapshot folder, it has a .pvtr file and 8 .vtr files, which were generated by MPI run with 8 processes. 

The level 1 tree of folder `example` is shown as following.
```shell
$ tree -L 1
.
├── fluid_0000
├── fluid_0001
└── fluid.pvd
```

To use this script, just simply go to folder `example` and run the script as following,
```
$ cd example
$ python ../pvtr2vtr.py
```
and then visualise the fluid flow by opening `fluid_collective.pvd` in Paraview.

For help info, just 
```shell
python pvtr2vtr.py --help
```
